> A tracer-bullet desktop Matrix client on Tauri 2 + matrix-rust-sdk + React —
> proving a clean, minimal, debt-free path exists.

## Goals

- End-to-end tracer bullet: login → sync → rooms → history → send → live receive → E2EE.
- Clean UI↔SDK seam so a future web (WASM) build slots in without a rewrite.
- Minimal, readable codebase — the anti-Element.
- Develop and test against a local Synapse instance.

## Getting Started

Desktop app scaffolded (Tauri 2 + React + TS); backend wired to
matrix-rust-sdk. Local Synapse is not yet provisioned — add it before the
login→sync tracer bullet (see `AGENTS.md`).

```bash
pnpm install            # frontend deps (allows esbuild build via pnpm-workspace.yaml)
cargo build             # Tauri backend (Rust) — in src-tauri/
pnpm tauri dev          # run the desktop app
```

A Matrix account on local Synapse is assumed to already exist (registration
is out of scope for v1).

## Architecture

- **Tauri 2 backend (Rust):** `src-tauri/`. Depends on `matrix-sdk` 0.18
  (default features: `e2e-encryption`, `automatic-room-key-forwarding`,
  `sqlite`). Will expose the SDK through a defined set of Tauri commands —
  the UI↔SDK seam. SDK uses rustls (no system-TLS linkage).
- **Vite + React frontend (TypeScript):** `src/`. Runs in the Tauri webview.
  Atomic Design + Feature-First structure emerge with the first feature.
  Depends only on the seam interface, never on raw SDK types.
- **Dev Synapse:** docker-compose homeserver for testing (including E2EE) —
  not yet provisioned.

## Browser debugging (Chromium)

The UI↔SDK seam is swappable via `createBackend()` (see `src/matrix.ts`):

- **Under Tauri** (`pnpm tauri dev`): uses `tauriBackend` → real Matrix over
  Tauri commands. This is where E2EE is verified.
- **In a plain browser** (`pnpm dev`, then open
  [http://localhost:1420](http://localhost:1420) in Chromium): uses
  `demoBackend`, which returns a canned login result — no server needed.
  This lets the agent drive and verify the **frontend** in Chromium (DevTools,
  headless) without the Tauri webview. It cannot verify E2EE (no real crypto).
- **Real in-browser backend (matrix-rust-sdk compiled to WASM):** build the
  binding once with `pnpm build:wasm`, then run
  `VITE_MATRIX_BACKEND=wasm pnpm dev` and open Chromium. `createBackend()` now
  selects `wasmBackend`, so login (and, once sync lands, E2EE) runs the real
  SDK in the browser — the path for verifying the crypto flow in Chromium.
  Requires a reachable Synapse (`dev/synapse`).

A production browser build with no backend throws a clear error; the real
in-browser Matrix backend (matrix-rust-sdk compiled to WASM) is the deferred
Phase C work (see `ketchup-plan.md`).
